BUILD WINDOWS .EXE INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

STEP 1: Setup on Windows Computer
----------------------------------
1. Install Python 3.11+ on Windows:
   https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Open Command Prompt (cmd.exe)

3. Navigate to this folder:
   cd path\to\perper

4. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements-desktop.txt


STEP 2: Build the .exe
-----------------------
1. Make sure .env file exists with your OPENAI_API_KEY

2. Run the build script:
   python build_windows.py

3. Wait 2-3 minutes for build to complete

4. Find your .exe in the "dist" folder:
   dist\InvoiceScanner.exe


STEP 3: Distribute
------------------
1. Copy InvoiceScanner.exe to any Windows computer

2. Double-click to run!

3. The app will open in a native window

4. Use it exactly like the web version:
   - Upload multiple invoice images
   - Get combined Excel file


ALTERNATIVE: Simple Run (No Build)
-----------------------------------
If you don't want to build an .exe, you can run directly:

1. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements-desktop.txt

2. Run:
   python desktop_app.py

3. App opens in native window!


NOTES:
------
- The .exe includes everything (Python, libraries, etc.)
- File size will be ~100-150MB
- No internet connection needed (except for OpenAI API calls)
- API key is embedded in the .exe from .env file
- Users don't need Python installed to run the .exe


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
If build fails:
1. Make sure all files are present (templates folder, .env, etc.)
2. Try: pip install --upgrade pyinstaller
3. Run as administrator

If .exe doesn't open:
1. Check Windows Defender didn't block it
2. Right-click → Properties → Unblock
3. Check .env file has valid OPENAI_API_KEY


ICON (Optional):
----------------
To add a custom icon:
1. Get a .ico file
2. Edit build_windows.py
3. Change '--icon=NONE' to '--icon=myicon.ico'

FIX WINDOWS DEFENDER BLOCKING
========================================

PROBLEM: Windows Defender deletes InvoiceScanner.exe or blocks it completely

This happens because PyInstaller .exe files trigger false positives.

========================================
SOLUTION 1: Add Exclusion (RECOMMENDED)
========================================

STEP 1: Extract the .exe first
-------------------------------
1. Download InvoiceScanner-Windows.zip
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., C:\InvoiceScanner\)
3. DO NOT run it yet


STEP 2: Add folder to Windows Defender exclusions
--------------------------------------------------
1. Press Windows key
2. Type: "Windows Security"
3. Open "Windows Security"
4. Click "Virus & threat protection"
5. Scroll down to "Virus & threat protection settings"
6. Click "Manage settings"
7. Scroll down to "Exclusions"
8. Click "Add or remove exclusions"
9. Click "Add an exclusion"
10. Choose "Folder"
11. Select: C:\InvoiceScanner\
12. Click "Select Folder"


STEP 3: Now run InvoiceScanner.exe
-----------------------------------
1. Go to C:\InvoiceScanner\
2. Double-click InvoiceScanner.exe
3. If SmartScreen appears:
   - Click "More info"
   - Click "Run anyway"
4. Done!


========================================
SOLUTION 2: Temporarily Disable Defender
========================================

NOT RECOMMENDED but works for testing:

1. Windows Security → Virus & threat protection
2. Manage settings
3. Turn OFF "Real-time protection"
4. Run InvoiceScanner.exe
5. Turn protection back ON after


========================================
SOLUTION 3: Alternative Download Location
========================================

Sometimes Defender is more aggressive with Downloads folder.

TRY:
1. Extract to Desktop instead of Downloads
2. Or extract to C:\Tools\
3. Then follow Solution 1


========================================
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
========================================

PyInstaller .exe files are commonly flagged as malware because:
1. They bundle Python runtime (looks suspicious to AV)
2. Many malware authors use PyInstaller
3. The .exe is unsigned (no certificate)

YOUR APP IS SAFE - You built it yourself from your own code!


========================================
PERMANENT FIX (For Distribution)
========================================

If you want to distribute this to others without issues:

OPTION 1: Code Signing Certificate
-----------------------------------
Cost: ~$200-300/year
Providers: DigiCert, Sectigo, GlobalSign

STEPS:
1. Buy certificate
2. Sign your .exe with: signtool.exe
3. Windows trusts signed executables

BENEFIT: No warnings, no blocks


OPTION 2: Build Reputation
---------------------------
Cost: Free
Time: Several weeks

STEPS:
1. Submit false positive report: 
   https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
2. Wait for Microsoft to review
3. After enough downloads, Windows learns it's safe

DOWNSIDE: Takes time, may not work


OPTION 3: Alternative Packaging
--------------------------------
Instead of PyInstaller, use:
- NSIS installer (wraps the .exe)
- WiX Toolset (creates .msi)
- Inno Setup (creates installer)

These are less likely to trigger Defender.


========================================
FOR END USERS - SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

If sharing this with others, tell them:

"""
WINDOWS SECURITY WARNING - THIS IS NORMAL

This app is safe but Windows blocks it because it's unsigned.

TO RUN THE APP:

1. Extract InvoiceScanner.exe to a folder
2. Right-click the folder → Properties
3. Check "Unblock" if shown → Apply
4. Add folder to Windows Defender exclusions:
   - Windows Security → Virus protection → Exclusions
   - Add the folder where you extracted the .exe
5. Run InvoiceScanner.exe
6. If blocked: Click "More info" → "Run anyway"

WHY: The app is not signed with a certificate ($200/year).
You can verify it's safe - you have the source code!
"""


========================================
QUICK TEST (5 minutes)
========================================

Want to test if it works?

1. Extract .exe to Desktop
2. Windows Security → Add Desktop to exclusions
3. Run InvoiceScanner.exe
4. Window should open in 5-10 seconds
5. Upload an invoice
6. Get Excel file!
